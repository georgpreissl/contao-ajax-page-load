## Contao AjaxPageLoad

A Contao Bundle to load pages with Ajax.  

## Information

The bundle provides a front-end module called 'Ajax Loader'. Pages can be selected in the settings of this module. These pages then appear in the front end as a simple menu. If one of the menu items is clicked, the content of the respective page is loaded into a div called "ajax-container".

For loading to work, jQuery must be activated in the layout settings in the backend.
